# Purpose

We show some very basic examples on how to use the reddening map that we published in [Lenz, Hensley & Doré (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00011).

The data is available on the [Harvard dataverse](http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/AFJNWJ).

Check out the [`ipython notebook`](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DanielLenz/ebv_tools/blob/master/examples.ipynb) which contains all the examples. Note that you only view them on the nbviewer service, and will have to clone the repository to run them on your machine.
